Please drag the file ‘Main Assignment’ into your OpenFrameworks apps folder in order for it to run properly! The code will work in OF 0.9.0

For a full description of the program, please look at the ‘Documentation for Dissolve’ file!

Note: I copied the maximilian.cpp and maximilian.h files from the Maximilian master folder to try and get maxiEnv to work properly. In the end I couldn’t get it to work, but the code seems to run ok with the replacements. If it doesn’t run properly on your computer, please copy the original maximilian for OpenFrameworks back into the maximilian.cpp and maximilian.h files!

Here is the URL of the video overview in case the link in the folder doesn’t work:
