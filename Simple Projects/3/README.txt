Hello!
 
In this project, when you move the mouse left to right it changes the speed of change
between the videos.
 
When you move the mouse up and down, it changes the volume of the highest note in the chord.

The note will only come in once you have gone above the halfway point on the screen.
 
The video clips are taken by me so there are no copyright issues :)
