Please drag the file ‘Simple Project 4’ into your OpenFrameworks apps folder in order for it to run properly! The code will work in OF 0.9.0

Hello!
 
In this project, when you move the mouse up and down and click, a circle will appear and a tone will be played. The screen is split into 5 sections vertically, one for each note of the selected chord.

To change the selected chord, press the ‘c’ key. It will cycle through 4 chords to play which all interact nicely with each other. 

Note: I copied the maximilian.cpp and maximilian.h files from the Maximilian master folder to try and get maxiEnv to work properly. In the end I couldn’t get it to work, but the code seems to run ok with the replacements. If it doesn’t run properly on your computer, please copy the original maximilian for OpenFrameworks back into the maximilian.cpp and maximilian.h files!

Thanks!
