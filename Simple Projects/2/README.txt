Hello!
 
This is a visual piece of code with no audio. There is also some mouse interaction. 
 
If you move the mouse left of the centre of the screen the shape will get smaller, 
and if you move it to the right the shape will get larger.
 
If you move the mouse up from the centre of the screen the shape will spin more in
one direction, and if you move it down it will spin more in the other direction.
