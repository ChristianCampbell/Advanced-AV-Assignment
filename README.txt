Hello!

This is the top folder for my Advanced AV coursework.

The total size of the projects is about 310mb due to the video files so please make sure you have enough hard drive space!

In the ‘Simple Projects’ folder you will find the four smaller projects. The README.txt files tell you what to do with them.

In the ‘Big Project - Dissolve’ folder you will find the larger project, documentation and video links for the overview. There is also another README.txt file in there telling you what to do.

I hope you enjoy it all!

Christian
